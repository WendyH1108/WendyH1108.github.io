My name is **Yingbing Huang (黄滢冰)**, you can also call me **Wendy**. I’m a PhD student at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/) advised by [Prof. Deming Chen](https://dchen.ece.illinois.edu/).

Before joining UIUC, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree with Honors at Cornell University in 2023, advised by [Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io/). 

My research lies in the various areas, including efficient machine learning, large language models, reinforcement learning, active learning and robotics.
