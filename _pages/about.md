My name is **Yingbing Huang (黄滢冰)**, you can also call me **Wendy**. I’m a PhD student at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/) advised by [Prof. Deming Chen](https://dchen.ece.illinois.edu/).

Before joining UIUC, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree with Honors at Cornell University in 2023. 

My research lies in the various areas, including efficient machine learning, large language models, reinforcement learning, active learning and robotics.
