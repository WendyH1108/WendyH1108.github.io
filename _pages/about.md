My name is **Yingbing Huang (黄滢冰)**, you can also call me **Wendy**. I’m a PhD student at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/) advised by [Prof. Deming Chen](https://dchen.ece.illinois.edu/).

Before joining UIUC, I obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s degree at Fudan University (复旦大学) in 2017 and 2019, respectively. During summers, I had spent time at Xilinx (2020), SiFive (2021), Intel (2022), and Google X (2023) as interns.

My research lies in the area of compilers, high-level synthesis (HLS), and hardware acceleration. Recently, I’ve been focused on HLS tools (ScaleHLS and XLS), domain-specific compilers (CIRCT and MLIR-AIE), and FPGA-based deep learning accelerators (HybridDNN and DNNExplorer).
